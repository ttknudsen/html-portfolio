<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>This movie is hilarious and stands the test of time. 
Watch the movie, then read the book, then watch the movie again! 
For the best viewing experience, watch the movie in a theater with a crowd reciting the lines.</p>

<p>The first of the Harry Potter series. Meet Harry as he discovers every kids daydream, that he is a wizard!</p>
<h3>Batman</h3>
